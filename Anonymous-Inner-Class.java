 An anonymous inner class is a class without a name that you create and use at the same time.
 "I need a small class here, but I don't need to create a separate named class for it."
 It's mainly designed for one-time or very specific use.
 If you need the same implementation in many places → create a normal named class instead.
 It can implement an interface
 It can extend a class

🔹 Rule 1: If you put a class after new, it creates an unnamed subclass (extends).
🔹 Rule 2: If you put an interface after new, it creates an unnamed implementing class (implements). 

It can never use both extends and implements at the same time.
It can never implement more than one interface.
An anonymous inner class can never extend more than one class.


Everything inside those highlighted {} curly braces is the body of a anonymous inner class


Since an anonymous inner class has no name, you can never write a constructor for it (because in Java, constructors must match the class name).
